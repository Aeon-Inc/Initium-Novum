    <description>
        <p>These machines were made to be given to those who are too sick or frail to continue living as they are. However, they need further testing in the field before they can be produced and given to the public. Therefore members of Aeon Industries are asked to give up their bodies of flesh and bone and become one of metal, gears, and wire for the greater good.</p>
        <h4>Appearance</h4>
        <p>Each Soul Mech is tailored for the person who is taking it. You keep your original appearance, except with metallic skin and glowing eyes. You lose all racial feature traits for example if you have wings you keep your wings however you can no longer use them to fly.</p>
        <h4>Names</h4>
        <p>Your name does not change.</p>
        <h4>Soul Mech Traits</h4>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Type.</em></strong> Humanoid as well as Construct.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> At this time we don’t know how long a Soul Mech can live for.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Your alignment doesn’t change.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size doesn’t change.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your speed doesn’t change.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Healing Machine.</em></strong> If the <i>mending spell</i> is cast on you, you can expend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).</p>
        <p class="indent">In addition, you were designed to benefit from common spells that preserve life but that normally don’t affect Constructs: <i>cure wounds</i>, <i>healing word</i>, <i>mass cure wounds</i>, <i>mass healing word</i>, and <i>spare the dying</i>.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry’s Rest.</em></strong> When you take a long rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you aren’t unconscious.</p>
        <p class="indent"><strong><em>Living Construct.</em></strong> Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. However, because of your previously human nature you find comfort in mimicking the acts of breathing and eating even though your body no longer needs those functions.</p>
